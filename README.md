AiNetStudio® develops software that bridges experimental hardware and AI neural networks to explore antigravity propulsion and manned drone technology. By linking real-time sensor data with adaptive machine learning, the project aims to fine-tune resonance and accelerate breakthroughs in next-generation aerospace research.

# AiAntiGravity

My name is [**Bill SerGio**](https://sergioapps.com/articles/articles.html)  
and I became one of the wealthiest men in America using AI Neural Networks 
I wrote to automate the buying of half hour blocks of television time to 
maximize net profits from my television shows. I thought I would apply AI 
and Neural networks to achieving balancing rotors in manned drones and 
devleopment real antigravity emgines.  

AI is accelerating discovery everywhere—from reading ancient scrolls with imaging + machine learning to optimizing complex physical systems.  
In every case, **fine-tuning to achieve resonance** is critical—and that’s where AI shines.

## Speculative Concepts

Reports about devices like the **“Graviflyer”** describe 
counter-rotating discs, high-voltage differentials, Tesla-coil 
RF bias, magnets, and ultrasound. If such effects exist, they’re 
likely *extremely* sensitive to resonance—exactly the kind of 
multi-parameter tuning AI can search efficiently while logging 
evidence from scales, probes, and sensors.  

The same principle applies to the **PAIS effect**, where plasma 
acoustic interactions appear only when voltages and frequencies 
align in just the right way, and to the work of **Thomas Townsend 
Brown**, whose electrogravitics experiments suggested lift from 
high-voltage fields when tuned into resonance.  

In every case, resonance is the fragile key, and AI provides the 
systematic exploration needed to find and hold it.

## Our Focus

I thought I would demonstrate how you can apply ML.NET to explore 
parameter spaces in safely simulated or instrumented setups—adjusting 
voltages, frequencies, phases, and rotations to lock onto stable 
resonant regimes.  

Unlike Python toolchains that often require stitching together many 
external libraries, ML.NET is natively integrated into the .NET ecosystem, 
giving us type safety, performance, and seamless deployment in our C# 
applications.  

Backed by Microsoft, it allows our research code to move directly into 
production Windows apps without rewrites, ensuring both speed and 
stability in experimentation.

---

### AI Type #1 – Physical Feedback
AI measures changes in lift or weight on a precision scale and dynamically 
adjusts voltages, frequencies, and rotations in a real-time feedback loop 
to tune resonance and maximize anti-gravity effects.

### AI Type #2 – Virtual Simulation
In this approach, the anti-gravity engine exists only in code. Components 
are modeled with physics-based formulas, and AI explores the parameter 
space virtually to discover resonant behaviors before any physical build 
is attempted.

## Winform Application .NET 9 CORE 9

## Explanation of CORE Naming
In November 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5.0, dropping the "Core” 
branding so all versions of .NET after 5.0 are "Core" apps. Commonly 
you will see .NET 9 applications refrred to as a "Core 9" applications 
because .NET 9 is a Core application.
