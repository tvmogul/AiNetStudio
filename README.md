AiNetStudio¬Æ develops software that bridges experimental hardware and AI neural networks to explore antigravity propulsion and manned drone technology. By linking real-time sensor data with adaptive machine learning, the project aims to fine-tune resonance and accelerate breakthroughs in next-generation aerospace research.

# AiAntiGravity

My name is [**Bill SerGio**](https://sergioapps.com/articles/articles.html)  
and I made a large fortune using AI Neural Networks I wrote to automate the buying of half hour blocks of television time to maximize net profits.  
I thought I would apply AI and Neural networks to achieving antigravity.  

AI is accelerating discovery everywhere‚Äîfrom reading ancient scrolls with imaging + machine learning to optimizing complex physical systems.  
In every case, **fine-tuning to achieve resonance** is critical‚Äîand that‚Äôs where AI shines.

## Speculative Concepts

Reports about devices like the **‚ÄúGraviflyer‚Äù** describe counter-rotating discs, high-voltage differentials, Tesla-coil RF bias, magnets, and ultrasound.  
If such effects exist, they‚Äôre likely *extremely* sensitive to resonance‚Äîexactly the kind of multi-parameter tuning AI can search efficiently while logging evidence from scales, probes, and sensors.  

The same principle applies to the **PAIS effect**, where plasma acoustic interactions appear only when voltages and frequencies align in just the right way, and to the work of **Thomas Townsend Brown**, whose electrogravitics experiments suggested lift from high-voltage fields when tuned into resonance.  

In every case, resonance is the fragile key, and AI provides the systematic exploration needed to find and hold it.

## Our Focus

I thought I would demonstrate how you can apply ML.NET to explore parameter spaces in safely simulated or instrumented setups‚Äîadjusting voltages, frequencies, phases, and rotations to lock onto stable resonant regimes.  

Unlike Python toolchains that often require stitching together many external libraries, ML.NET is natively integrated into the .NET ecosystem, giving us type safety, performance, and seamless deployment in our C# applications.  

Backed by Microsoft, it allows our research code to move directly into production Windows apps without rewrites, ensuring both speed and stability in experimentation.

### AI Type #1 ‚Äì Physical Feedback
AI measures changes in lift or weight on a precision scale and dynamically adjusts voltages, frequencies, and rotations in a real-time feedback loop to tune resonance and maximize anti-gravity effects.

### AI Type #2 ‚Äì Virtual Simulation
In this approach, the anti-gravity engine exists only in code. Components are modeled with physics-based formulas, and AI explores the parameter space virtually to discover resonant behaviors before any physical build is attempted.
